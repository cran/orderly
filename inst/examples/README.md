## `orderly` examples

These examples exist primarily to be used in `orderly`'s tests and documentation, though they may be useful for demonstrating how to lay files in different situations

* `demo`: a collection of reports that exercise most of the core features of orderly (used to create reference data for regression testing)
* `minimal`: a fairly minimal `orderly` example with just one report
* `nodb`: even more minimal than `minimal` - this case does not use any source databases
